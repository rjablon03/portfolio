                        <p>K-fleet is an application built as a hypothetical replacement to my companyâ€™s current vehicle check-out process. Currently, the company uses Microsoft Outlook to check out cars. Cars are treated like meeting rooms, and to check one out, you invite it to a "meeting." This is problematic because it can be a complicated and unintuitive process. Other issues include users not being required to write a description, cars not being checked back in, and no standardized way of seeing which cars are available (each employee has their own method).</p>
